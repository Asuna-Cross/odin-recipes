        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>225g/8oz self-raising flour</li>
            <li>75g/ 2 1/2oz caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>125g/4 1/2oz unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
            <li>150g/5 1/2oz dried fruit</li>
            <li>1 free-range egg</li>
            <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and rub in the cubed butter until the mitxure 
                looks like breadcrumbs, then mix in the dried fruit.</li>
            <li>In a clean bowl, beat the egg and milk together with the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture just comes 
                together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you need it to make the mixture stick together.</li>
            <li>Place golfball-sized spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking tray. Leave space between 
                them as they will flatten and spread out to double their size during baking.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15â€“20 minutes, until golden-brown. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.</li>
        </ol>
