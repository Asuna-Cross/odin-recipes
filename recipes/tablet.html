        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>900g Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>250ml Full-fat Milk</li>
            <li>110g Butter</li>
            <li>397g Condensed Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the sugar and milk in a large pan over a gentle heat. 
                Stir occasionally until all the sugar has dissolved. Pre-grease 
                a 13×9 inch tin with a generous amount of butter and set aside.</li>
            <li>Once all the sugar has dissolved add the butter and allow to melt.</li>
            <li>When the butter has melted, add the condensed milk and mix well. 
                Increase the heat and stir continuously while the mixture boils and 
                reaches Soft-Ball stage (120°c) on your sugar thermometer.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and allow the mixture to settle a little 
                before beating. Beat with a wooden spoon in the pan until the mixture 
                if almost setting. This may take a good bit of beating!</li>
            <li>Transfer to your pre-greased tray and spread evenly to the edges/corners.</li>
            <li>Leave to set for at least a couple of hours but ideally overnight. If you 
                want neatly cut squares/bars of tablet score your tablet in your desired 
                size/shape about 30 minutes into setting. Alternatively you can simply 
                break the tablet into individual servings once set for a more 
                rustic feel.
            </li>
        </ol>
